# UiPath-RPA-Associate-v1.0

# DAY-0 Preparation 
As a part of bridging the gap between Academia and Industry, I was nominated and selected from Department of Mechatronics Engineering for this certification course on **The UiPath Certified RPA Associate (UiRPA)**
## Course Expectation
[1] to be able to independently design and develop simple RPA solutions or 
[2] be a productive member of an automation team led by an experienced RPA Developer responsible for developing complex solutions using UiPathtechnologies.

## Evaluation Criteria 
This exam assesses knowledge and skills related to 
- problem solving, 
- process identification, and 
- building simple automation solutions with UiPath platform components such as **UiPath Studio, Robots, and Orchestrator**. 

**UiRPA is the first step for professionals who want to build and assess their knowledge and skills towards their journey to become an Advanced RPA Developer, Solution Architect or RPA Architect.**

## Products that We will be learning:

- UiPath Studio version 2020.10
